# stage0_fran_evaluate

An evaluation pipeline designed to assess and enhance the performance of Fran, the facilitator Discord bot within the Stage0 ecosystem.

## Overview

Fran is an AI-powered Discord bot developed as part of the Stage0 project by the Agile Learning Institute. Its primary function is to assist engineering teams in designing, building, and running software platforms by facilitating communication and providing automated support. The `stage0_fran_evaluate` project establishes a systematic approach to evaluate Fran's underlying models, ensuring they meet the desired performance and reliability standards.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics:** Utilizes a suite of metrics to assess Fran's performance, including response accuracy, relevance, and user satisfaction.

- **Automated Testing Framework:** Implements automated tests to simulate various interaction scenarios, ensuring consistent and reliable performance.

- **Continuous Integration:** Integrates with CI/CD pipelines to facilitate ongoing evaluation and rapid deployment of improvements.

- **Detailed Reporting:** Generates comprehensive reports highlighting strengths and areas for improvement, guiding future development efforts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or higher:** Ensure Python is installed on your system.

- **Dependencies:** Install necessary Python packages using pip:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
